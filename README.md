# Tools 

1.Eclipse 

2. Selenium Webdriver

3. Apache POI (for reading data from Excel files)

4. Excel (for writing the test data in a tabular form)

5. TestNG ( for verification & Results)

# Usage
The whole project development takes place in the Eclipse development environment.Download Selenium and Apache POI then imports its jars.

Hybrid approach - I used data driven framework as the automatioin testing framework. My test data is created in the excel sheet and i then imported it into
the selenium automation testing tool to feed the web application under test.

To modify the Excel sheet in Selenium web driver i used Apache POI (Poor Obfuscation Implementation), It is an API written in java to support
read and write operations.To use Apache POI you need to install it first and then imported the necessary jars from Apache POI.

# Test Tesuls
To view the test results, TestNG is used as it provides the results from the test execution.
